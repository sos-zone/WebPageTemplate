                    We define a child as someone under the age of 13 years. Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information using our browser or websites without their consent, he or she should contact us at admin@visibleinternet.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.
                    Security
                    Your security is important to us and we follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) the company encrypts the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                    Changes to our Privacy Policy
                    The following Privacy Policy may change to reflect compliance with new laws, new products and new technology. If the company makes a change to this privacy policy we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). Cybersafe247.com Limited may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
                    Information We Collect and Store.
                    We may collect and store the following types of information when running the Visible Internet Applications and Services:
                    Information Provided by You.
                    When you register to download the Visible Internet browser the company collects some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services.
                    During the installation process, or at some time thereafter, you may be asked to provide certain information that Visible Internet will use to personalize content presented to you through the browser. The information gathered by the browser will not be tied to any information that would identify you personally.
                    Personal Information
                    The Visible Internet browser may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information.

                    How We Collect and Use Information
                    We collect the following types of information about you:
                    Registration and Profile Information. When you create an account, we may collect your personal information such as your username, first and last name, birth date, email address, mobile phone number and a photo, if you chose to have a photo associated with your account. If you want to add a child or family member’s name to your account, we collect the child or family member’s name, email address, and mobile phone number. We may collect billing information when you sign up for Premium service. We may collect additional information from a parent in order to obtain verifiable parental consent to allow a child to use our Service.

                    Geolocation. We collect your unique user identifier and your location through GPS, WiFi, or wireless network triangulation in order to obtain your location for the purposes of providing our Service. 

                    Information we collect automatically through the use of technology:
                    When you visit our websites or use our mobile app may collect certain information about your computer or device through technology such as cookies, web beacons, log files, or other tracking/recording tools. The information we collect through the use of tracking technologies includes, but is not limited to, IP address, browser information, referring/exit pages and URLs, click stream data and how you interact with links on the website, mobile app, or Service, domain names, landing pages, page views, cookie data that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, browsing behavior on our site, mobile device type, mobile device IDs or other persistent identifiers, and location data collected from your mobile device. Some or all of this data may be combined with other personally identifying information described above.

                    We use this information to:
                    1. Remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site or mobile app;
                    2. Provide custom, personalized content and information;
                    3. Monitor the effectiveness of our Service and our marketing campaigns;
                    4. Monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, users, traffic, and demographic patterns;
                    5. Diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses or User IDs; and
                    6. Automatically update our mobile application on your system and related device.

                    Cybersafe247.com Limited cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

                    Your Choices About Your Information
                    You may, of course, decline to submit any personal information through the Service, in which case we may not be able to provide its Services to you.

                    Modifying Your Account Information and Settings: You may modify your account information, update or amend your personal information, or change your password at any time by logging in to your account.

                    Opting Out of Collection of Tracking Data: The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser. Please refer to your browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.
